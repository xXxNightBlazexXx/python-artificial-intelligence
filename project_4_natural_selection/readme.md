## Generations
This is the number of total time the GA is going to run effectively.

## Population size
In the context of TSP, the population size represents the number of routes generated per iteration of the GA algorthm. Call it a sample pool if you will. That means for population_size = 750, there will be 750 total random routes generated each generation.

### Chromosome
For TSP and GA, a chromosome is 1 entire route of the TSP problem.

### Gene
Genes represent each element of a chromosome, which represents a city for TSP. The ordering of the genes represents the order in which the cities are visited in the route.
